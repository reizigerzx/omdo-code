# Relaunching Projects

Since I messed up with my life lately, especially for the last 2 months, I tried to be mindful as possible. Re-organizing my mental model, coping with my latest trauma regarding the toxic environment that surrounded me on my last job, compromising with my mom and older brother about what and how I'm going to do next, and lastly I'm finally reached my peak of productivity than ever start from today. I was shit this past 2 months, wasting alot of time playing games and learn unnecessary things which has no clear impact on my life whatsoever. But now I fullfilled my emotional thought and regained back my clear mind and mental model. And I think this is the best time I dispatch myself into a better new world. With brand new mindset, brand new people to work with, and especially, "brand New Me". A passionate, Energetic, and emphatetic person, ready to face anyone who are gonna look down on me.

And Here is the project I believe that will change maybe a little bit of our society how to think and behave properly not only in real world but also behave properly on the Internet in this dying technology age.

Due to the wrong configuration on my Pycharm settings, I accidentally revert commited my local repo from my empty github repo, which was causing my project to be wiped out, empty. So here I today putting all my remaining latest mental model of my code into saver place to github repo.

Here I created more readable and more structured version of the code. I put them into separated file to make sure 1 file take 1 responsibility. (Following single responsibility principle)
